🖊️ Objective:
Analyzing the flight booking dataset obtained from the “Kaggle” website and conducting various statistical hypothesis tests in order to get meaningful information from it. 

📁 The dataset was taken from Kaggle: https://lnkd.in/gbPNQdib

✨ In this project, I performed :
- Data Preprocessing, 
- Exploratory Deep Analysis (EDA), 
- Feature Engineering, 
- Feature Interpretation, 
- Machine Learning Modelling with Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boosting Regressor,
- Evaluation,
- Model Deployment with Gradio, and
- Log Prediction Model.

🔎 Summary:
💡 EDA revealed trends in ticket pricing, duration, and airline distribution.
💡Outliers were capped to ensure better model stability.
💡Feature engineering incorporated categorical and numeric data effectively.
💡A Random Forest model achieved strong predictive performance with 98.42%, MAE of 10.92%, and RSME of 28.5%.
